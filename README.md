# 🎧 Discover Weekly Archiver

> *Never forget to listen to your Discover Weekly again!*

## 💡 Problem

I would always forget to listen to my **Discover Weekly** playlist on time — and by the next week, it would be gone. 

## 🛠️ Solution

To solve this, I wrote a Python script that:

* 🐍 Uses **Spotipy**, **Time**, and **Flask**
* 📆 Runs **every Monday**
* 🎶 Automatically **moves songs** from my “Discover Weekly” playlist
* 📁 Archives them into a new playlist called **“Discover Weekly Archive”**

## ✅ Outcome

Now I have a playlist filled with **weekly music recommendations**, saved forever!
Whenever I feel like exploring new music or catching up on what I missed, it's all there. 🌟🎵
