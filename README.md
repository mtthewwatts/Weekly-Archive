I would always forget to forget to listen to my Discover Weekly playlist.

In order to solve this problem for myself, I programmed a Python script that uses the Spotipy, Time, and Flask libraries
in order to automatically move every song from my “Discover Weekly” playlist every Monday to a separate playlist known as “Discover Weekly Archive”. 

This allows me to have a playlist filled with personalized music suggestions whenever I want to expand my music taste!
